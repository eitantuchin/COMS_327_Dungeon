    types of cells.  A rooms array contains all the rooms in the dungeon.

        the dungeon and then adds the room in a random location of 
        random size. Then the stairs are added to the rooms randomly.
    addCorridors:
        Calculates the closest room tothe current room using Euclidean distance. 
        Iterates through the rooms array to create connections between all rooms.
