New/Updated Files:
    dungeon_path_finding.c contains all logic with added path finding.
    dungeon_path_finding.h contains framework for dungeon_path_finding.c.
    priority_queue.c contains all logic for the priority queue data structure.
    priority_queue.h contains framework for priority_queue.c.

New/Updated Data Structures:
    priority queue:
        - an implementation of a priority queue for path finding
    nonTunnelingMap:
        - 2d int array containing non-tunneling map distances
    tunnelingMap:
        - 2d int array containing tunneling map distances

New/Updated Functions:
    calculateDistances:
        - Uses a priority queue together with Dijikstra's algorithm to calculate the distances 
            using 8-way connectivity from any point on the map for both non-tunneling and
            tunneling monsters to the PC.
    main:
        - Updated to print both distance maps and calculate distances.
    pq_create:
        - Creates the priority queue.
    pq_destroy:
        - Uninitializes the priority queue.
    pq_is_empty:
        - Checks if the PQ is empty.
    pq_insert:
        - Inserts a node into the PQ.
    pq_extract_min:
        - Extracts the node at the top of the Q.
    pq_decrease_priority:
        - Decreases the priority of a node.
    pq_swap:
        - Swaps two nodes in the PQ.
    pq_heapify:
        - Maintains the heap structure.
